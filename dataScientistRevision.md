## Revision Strategies

1. Create summary sheets for each major topic
2. Implement small projects to apply concepts
3. Solve practice problems and coding challenges
4. Explain concepts to others or teach a mini-lesson
5. Review real-world case studies in each area
6. Participate in online forums and discussions
7. Stay updated with recent developments in the field

Remember to focus on understanding the core principles and their applications rather than memorizing details. Practice implementing these concepts in code and on real datasets to reinforce your understanding.
